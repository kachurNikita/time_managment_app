# Acomplished tasks  
# Create column at database which stands for the date and time +

 Create function wich allows usto check does quadrat's importance exist

# Create function - for optimization where i see that commands repeats 
# (break down sqlite_con function: 1. specificaly for sqlite connections, func for commands, such as: create table and Insert into)



# Create function which will display to me what i have to do at the current moment

#  if it is only one quadrat  task will be added there and i have to choose button (work or personal)
# It identify day and also it identify time 
#  if it is a Weekends work task will not be displayed 


# Have a window with input: ADD TASK and after task specification give quadrat name if none exists 
# Function add task where i can just simply write the task, and it will ask at which quadrat i want add this task,
# if there are no quadrats, will call function create quadrate and will add this task to the database
# Store somewhere acomplished tasks

# Create function display task:
# Identify day
# identify current time 
# identify the table which is exists (green, yeelow, blue, red) - green (urgent-important) - make 
# When creating table, create separate database in order to
