Day 2
I was thinking, what type of time managment technique shoud i use in order to achieve desired result. And came to conclusion.
Eisenhower Matrix could be a good idea to create. I heardabout this method before and even used it, but not to long.
I think it is a time to give it  a second chance  by emplementing this as a software.

My goal for today, what i am trying to acheive:
1. Store data in data structure. I would probably create an object with all matrix quadrats, and inside i would store multiple objects
created with some data already. 
2. I also would like prioritize  tasks inside each of the quadrats, especially those one, which is not time consuming (1 h/max).
3. Another my tought is bind real-time to tasks. I want to specify, that for example from 9 to 5 i have to do my job, and
See the tasks which is job related, simply saying, from 9 to 5 i don't want see urgent and important while  the job.
4. Also, it is for me personally do some small breaks at the job, between 5-10 minutes. Maybe work for 45 minutes straight,
and after that give to mysrlfa 10 minutes break,
but while this break, job time is stops and the other quadratis pops up. 10 minutes
break maybe pop up the tasks from important tab,such as: pay a bills, apply for another job, or read some book or article.
I think it is important, becasue some tasks personal  can be handeld at the working day, for example, i need call to uscis 
in order to retrieve information about my girlfriend's SSN. I can't do that after 5 PM.
5. Also it could  be nice specify time that at least require for me to spend, for example: study programming for 1 hour
or  pay my bills 10 minutes, 

Day 3 05/23/2024
Last days was kind of hard to sit for the project, glad that  i found sometime today. Still how to store tasks properly
so this could work for me. I am just writing everything as i remember, later if my function wil  work as i want,
i will change it to OOP.
